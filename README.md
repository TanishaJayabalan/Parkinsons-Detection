# ðŸ§  Parkinson's Detection via Multimodal Analysis

A **Streamlit**-based web application for early detection of **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease** using **handwriting**, **voice**, and **typing test** inputs.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

This app provides a simple interface with three diagnostic tools:

1. **Handwriting Analysis**
   - Upload an image of a spiral youâ€™ve drawn.
   - The system analyzes tremor patterns and deviations typically associated with Parkinsonâ€™s.

2. **Voice Analysis**
   - Upload an audio clip of yourself producing a sustained vowel sound (like "aaah").
   - The app extracts and evaluates features such as:
     - MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
     - Jitter and shimmer
     - Vocal fold health indicators

3. **Typing Test**
   - Press and hold the **spacebar** as instructed.
   - Measures finger fatigue, motor control, and reaction consistency.

Each option redirects you to a dedicated page for input and real-time analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons-detector.git
cd parkinsons-detector
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
